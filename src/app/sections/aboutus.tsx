            Welcome to KaPi Care, where pets are family and their well-being is our top priority.

            My name is Kacey, and I embarked on a life-changing journey when I moved to Mérida, Mexico, in August 2022. Far from home and seeking companionship for my beloved pets, I met Pilar. Little did I know that this meeting would not only provide excellent care for my furry friends but also blossom into a deep friendship.

            Pilar, with her decade-long experience in pet sitting and two decades as a dedicated high school English teacher, brought a wealth of compassion and expertise to every pet she cared for. As I navigated my personal journey of self-discovery and rekindled my passion for technology and programming, an idea sparked – a platform that seamlessly connects pet owners with trusted sitters, ensuring pets are loved and cared for like family.

            Thus, KaPi Care was born – a culmination of our shared vision for exceptional pet care and the power of technology to bring people together. At KaPi Care, we strive to make pet sitting easy, accessible, and stress-free for both pet parents and sitters. Whether you're traveling, working late, or simply need a helping hand, KaPi Care is here to provide reliable and loving care for your furry companions.

            Join us in creating a world where pets thrive, families stay connected, and every wag of a tail is met with love and care.

            Welcome to KaPi Care – Where Pets and Care Unite.
